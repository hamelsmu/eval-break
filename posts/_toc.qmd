# TOC Test

```{python}
#| output: asis
class Foo:
    def __init__(self): ...
    def _repr_markdown_(self):
        return """
## Hello This is a Test Of Markdown Output

Some other stuff here

### If this doesn't appear in the TOC could be a bug.
        """

Foo()
```

You can use `lorem ipsum` to document apis.

```{python}
print('hello')
```

```{python}
def fibonacci(n):
    a = 0
    b = 1
     
    # Check is n is less
    # than 0
    if n < 0:
        print("Incorrect input")
         
    # Check is n is equal
    # to 0
    elif n == 0:
        return 0
       
    # Check if n is equal to 1
    elif n == 1:
        return b
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            c = a + b
            a = b
            b = c
        return b
```

```{python}
[fibonacci(n) for n in range(100)]
```
